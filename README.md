# SkyJS
A JavaScript Library for Building Interactive Web UIs

## FAQs

### - Why SkyJS?
- While it's up to you to choose your UI library, we created SkyJS to allow you to design interactive user interfaces using only HTML and JavaScript, without the need for any compilation or bundling.

### - Is SkyJS Fast?
- SkyJS is built entirely in JavaScript, which means that its speed is the same as the native speed of JavaScript in web browsers. SkyJS does not use any compilers.
